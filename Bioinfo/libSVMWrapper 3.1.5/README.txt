What is it?

	libSVMWrapper is a .NET wrapper for libsvm.dll and is provided to you under LGPL license version 3.

	This library should work with 32bit version of libsvm.dll.

	If you do not find any functionality or find a problem with a wrapper, let me know or add/repair it and then let me know.
	I will incorporate it in this library and place your name in acknowledgments.

	If you find this wrapper usefull and want to give your gratitude to me, let me know ;).

Advantages:

    Does not use any unsafe code.
    Includes method TrainAuto, which searches for best parameter in grids which is similar to used in OpenCV.MachineLearning
    Usage is very similar to libsvm itself, so migration from it to .NET should be very easy.
    Ease of use. See DOCS
